# Data description
In 2022, the University of Washington and the King County Regional Housing Authority (KCRHA) implemented a network-based method for estimating the number of people experiencing homelessness, which includes those experiencing doubled-up homelessness. The initial pilot project was followed by a larger pilot study conducted in 2023, resulting in two datasets containing network, demographic and needs assessment data from 1,100+ people experiencing homelessness in the Seattle area in 2023. 

* Dataset #1 - Survey and network data from ~850 individuals experiencing homelessness in Seattle. Variables collected include basic demographics, location of previous night’s sleep (shelter, tent, car, with a friend, in a park, etc.), veteran status, substance use and mental health, and support services needed.

* Dataset #2 - Survey and network data from ~250 individuals experiencing homelessness in the great Puget Sound area. This dataset was collected by a different researcher using similar methodology with a more extensive set of survey questions.

I will primarily be working with a merged dataset, that pulls from both datasets, keeps common variables, and accounts for individuals that appear in both surveys. 

# Roles and responsibilities
2 PIs at the University of Washington (UW) are responsible for implementing the DMP for the project. Below are some of the DMP roles and the primary person or people responsible: 
* Data manager, DMP implementation and quality control – primarily PIs though some quality control may be assigned to other project leads, such as researcher assistants and graduate students. 
* Protection of sensitive and protected data, access control –  PIs control access to data–see below for training required before researchers can access data through secure servers.
* Data collection/data generation – PIs led data collection efforts, with other research scientists and graduate students leading the effort to organize data collection and train volunteers and students for survey data collection.
* Data organization, metadata generation, data analysis, software creation and maintenance – PI leads with graduate students and other researchers responsible for much of this work as it relates to individual projects using the data. 
* Archiving and preservation – primarily the PIs, but also may be assigned to a research assistants and graduate students
