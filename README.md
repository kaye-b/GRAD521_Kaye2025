The focus of this research is to quantify and better understand the population of people in the greater Seattle area who are experiencing doubled-up homelessness. Doubled-up homelessness is defined as individuals staying with friends, relatives, or others, due to economic hardship or housing loss, in order to avoid falling into homelessness. Doubled-up homelessness often leads to overcrowded living situations and is characterized by negative outcomes. The exclusion of the doubled-up homeless population from formal counts of literal homelessness leads to an underestimation of the problem's scope and impaired effectiveness of responses to the homelessness crisis.
